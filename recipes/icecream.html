    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I'll be honest, I have no idea how to make ice cream. But I do know how to buy it.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      I guess these aren't <em>ingredients</em> in the usual sense, but whatever!
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A mode of transportation</li>
      <li>A place that sells ice cream</li>
      <li>Money</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
      I mean its pretty obvious from here, but I'll spell it out.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Use the mode of transportation to go to the place that sells ice cream</li>
      <li>Buy the ice cream</li>
      <li>Eat the ice cream</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      That is how one <strong>consumes</strong> ice cream.
